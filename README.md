# Leaderboard

This is a prototype for a freeCodeCamp leaderboard application. The idea is to be able to track global contributions to our community across multiple platforms.

This project is still a work in progress, and is subject to change, deprecation, or archival at any time.

This project is not yet an official freeCodeCamp application.

The client is built with Angular and TypeScript, and the API is built with TypeScript and Express.
