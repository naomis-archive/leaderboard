# Using the Project

The client is hosted at https://leaderboard.nhcarrigan.com and the API is at https://leaderboard-api.nhcarrigan.com. Most of your interaction with the project should be through the client - the API currently has only one endpoint and sends raw JSON data.

The contribution data is aggregated from each of our platforms, and is scoped to the last seven days of contributing.

## Top Ten Contributors

Selecting the `Leaderboard` link in the naviagation bar will show you the top ten contributors on each of our platforms. Here you can view our most prolific contributors, and see if you made it to the top.

## Platform Views

Selecting the `Crowdin`, `Forum`, `GitHub`, or `News` links will take you to a view that displays all of the contributor rankings for that specific platform over the last week. You can then use your browser's `find` feature to check for your username in the table.

## Additional Features

Additional features will be coming soon - as they are added, this documentation will be updated.
